# Populating the Recurrence Rule



## The recurrence editor can be populated either from a RecurrenceRule object or from a string.



````C#
	     
	
RecurrenceEditor1.RecurrenceRule = new DailyRecurrenceRule(1, range);
// or

RecurrenceEditor1.RecurrenceRule = new DailyRecurrenceRule(1, range)
' or

````


## The following examples show how different rules can be generated in FormCrated event of the Scheduler.
